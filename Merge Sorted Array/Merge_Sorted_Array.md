## 🔍 **Example Walkthrough:**

*Example 1*

**Input:**

```
nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
```

**Output:**

```
[1,2,2,3,5,6]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.
```

*Example 2*

**Input:**

```
nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0
```

**Output:**

```
[1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1] and [].
The result of the merge is [1].
```

*Example 3*

**Input:**

```
nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1
```

**Output:**

```
[1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [] and [1].
The result of the merge is [1].
Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1. The 0 is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.
```
## 💻 Code (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public void merge(int[] num1, int m, int[] num2, int n) {

        int i = m - 1;
        int j = n - 1;
        int k = m + n - 1;

        while(i >= 0 && j >= 0){
            if(num1[i] > num2[j]){
                num1[k] = num1[i];
                i--;
            }
            else{
                num1[k] = num2[j];
                j--;
            }
            k--;
        }

        while(j >= 0){
            num1[k] = num2[j];
            j--;
            k--;
        }
    }
}
```
